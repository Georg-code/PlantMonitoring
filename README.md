# Plant Moisture Monitoring & Alerting

In a biology project for school, we want to keep all factors as constant as possible, except for our variable. This also includes the water and how much of it the plant gets. This project was developed in order to monitor this and prevent possible dehydration. Please keep in mind. The project is a proof of concept and designed for this one application. Code quality plays less of a role.
